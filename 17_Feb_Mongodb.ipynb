    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model to store and manage data. Rather than using the traditional relational database model with tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in collections of JSON-like documents. Each document can have its own unique structure, and can include arrays and sub-documents, making it a very flexible and dynamic database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and is often used for applications that require scalability and high availability, such as web applications, social networks, and mobile apps. MongoDB also provides features such as dynamic schema, auto-sharding, replication, and high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to the open-source version, MongoDB also offers a commercial version with advanced features and support, as well as a cloud-based database-as-a-service platform called MongoDB Atlas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that store and manage data in a way that is different from traditional relational databases. Non-relational databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and are often used in modern web applications, mobile apps, and big data systems. Unlike relational databases, which organize data into tables with rows and columns, non-relational databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, graph, and column-family. These data models allow for flexible schema and can better handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, sensor data, and machine data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some scenarios where it may be preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases:\n",
    "1. Unstructured data: If you have unstructured or semi-structured data, then MongoDB is a better fit as it is designed to store and retrieve documents. In contrast, SQL databases are designed for structured data with pre-defined tables and columns.\n",
    "2. Big Data: MongoDB is designed to handle Big Data and supports sharding and replication to distribute data across multiple servers. SQL databases are better suited for smaller data sets.\n",
    "3. Complex queries: MongoDB provides a flexible query language that supports complex queries with nested documents and arrays. SQL databases are better suited for simpler, more structured queries.\n",
    "4. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers, while SQL databases are designed to scale vertically by adding more CPU or memory to the server. If your application needs to scale horizontally, then MongoDB is a better fit.\n",
    "- In general, MongoDB is a better fit for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and the ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. SQL databases are better suited for applications that require complex joins, transactions, and strict schema requirements. However, it's important to evaluate your specific requirements and choose the database that best meets your needs."

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is designed to store and retrieve large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data as documents in a flexible JSON-like format. This allows for the storage of complex, nested data structures, making it ideal for handling unstructured data.\n",
    "2. Flexible schema: MongoDB allows for a flexible schema, which means that documents in a collection can have different fields and structures. This allows for dynamic updates to the database schema and can make it easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "3. Aggregation: MongoDB supports a powerful aggregation framework, which allows for the processing and analysis of large datasets. This framework includes a wide range of operators and stages, which can be combined to perform complex data transformations.\n",
    "4. Ad-hoc queries: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that allows for complex ad-hoc queries on large datasets. This query language supports a range of operators and functions, including aggregation functions, regular expressions, and full-text search.\n",
    "5. Transactions: Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB introduced support for multi-document transactions, allowing for atomic operations on multiple documents. This enables more complex data manipulation and transaction management.\n",
    "6. Indexing: MongoDB provides support for indexing, allowing for fast query performance even on large datasets. It also supports various types of indexes, including compound indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes.\n",
    "7. Transactions: Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB introduced support for multi-document transactions, allowing for atomic operations on multiple documents. This enables more complex data manipulation and transaction management."
